Jiggins-Home
============

New Home for my development work.

Uses:

- [Codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) "kit" language to import headers/content/footers
- Sass

Feeds for flickr and twitter are [based on my "feeds" git](https://github.com/mattjiggins/Backbone-PHP-Feeds) , and are BackboneJS and PHP.
