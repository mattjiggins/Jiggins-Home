Personal statements are always difficult to write. This is my attempt at describing what I'm looking for. If you're looking for a classic technical biography <a href="/classic-biography">click here</a>.

I have worked for some <a href="http://www.cpd.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">great people</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Layton" target="_blank">visionary leaders</a>, <a href="http://www.usw.ca" target="_blank">meaningful and principaled organizations</a>. I want that to continue.

I have never needed to apply for a job in my entire life.

If you want to test my skills, or my abilities then you should look elsewhere, I clearly won't fit in your organization. You can see the work I've done on this website, and my public repo's on <a href="https://github.com/mattjiggins" target="_blank">github</a>.

###Where I am.

In 2007, after a decade in *"classic" IT management* with the Canadian equivalent of the Labour Party I decided to setup a web/technology consulting business focused on non-Profit and Higher Education. Since 2007 I have had a very successful freelance business. My primary client is <a href="http://www.cpd.utoronto.ca">Continuing Professional Development</a> at the University of Toronto. Working with a single large client has enabled me to help them deliver some really innovative solutions: WordPress network with over 89 sites; NodeJS API linked to their Event Management System; Functional, mobile-friendly websites.

###Where I want to be. 

For the past 7 years I have been creating, designing, developing, deploying and maintaining websites alone. As technolgies advance it becomes more difficult to be an *expert generalist*. I would be an incredible manager of any development team. I understand the development tools out there, and know what "feels right and wrong". Beyond my design-development skills, my primary asset is communication. I am able to communicate technical concepts to the non-technical.

###What I'm really looking for.

**If I'm working for you, I'm pationate about what you do.** You could be a creative agency with incredible clients; a startup with a great idea and fantastic talent; a non-profit trying to save the world from itself.
