								<h2 class="details-content--row-title">Initial Presentation</h2>
								<p>The website had to be responsive. To accomplish this I tried an <a href="http://bradfrost.com/" target="_blank">Atomic Design</a> approach. Presenting the client with pieces of what might be on the website, in horizontal rather than vertical format. This helped focus the client on content pieces.</p>
								
								<p>During discussions with the CPD communications department it became clear that there were many different and competing sections within the organization. Each section had a slightly different goal or objective. However, ultimately the organization is about "educational events". There are two distinct groups: Organizers (Educators) and Attendees (Doctors and Other Health Professionals).</p>
								
								<p>My thought was each group needs its own "action word". Educators want to <strong>Educate</strong> and Attendees want to <strong>Learn</strong>.</p>
								
								<p>The third primary section within the department was <strong>Research</strong>. This was a strong enough word to remain as it was.</p>
								<p>Finally, after some debate, and to fit with their separately discovered "tag" the fourth action word was <strong>Transform</strong>.</p>

								<h2 class="details-content--row-title">A Mockup</h2>
								<p>Now we have our "Action" words - do we need to explain them? The initial design mockup showed 6 action words with some explainations in each box. The idea of matching Colour and Action also starts to be finalized. Red (strongest) represents the Learn or Event Registration.</p>
								<p><strong>At this stage a basic HTML, SASS framework is created. Design comes out of Photoshop and starts in the Browser.</strong></p>
								<p>However, presenting the client a design inside a computer seems to greatly enhance acceptance.</p>

								<h2 class="details-content--row-title">The Options</h2>
								<p>Time to present the client with three options. <strong>Option One</strong> is the revised version of the initial mockup. <strong>Option Two</strong> is a client proposed option to "move the events listing up to the top". <strong>Option Three</strong> is a radical re-design of the action words.</p>
								<p>Option Three goes to full development.</p>

								<h2 class="details-content--row-title">The Build</h2>
								<p>Initial build will be in WordPress alone, however the live site presented a major obsticle: Event listing must occur on the homepage. In the past a simple link to their Event Management System was used.</p>
								<p>To do this I created a simple read-only JSON REST Api to their existing MySQL data. Their event management system was written in Ruby. <a href="http://www.slimframework.com/">SlimFramework</a> was perfect for this task.</p>
								<p>Initally the code was written in basic JS/jQuery. Recently <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" target="_blank">BackboneJS</a> has been used to cleanup and simplify the events search listing.</p>
